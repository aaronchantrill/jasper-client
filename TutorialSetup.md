# Tutorial Setup

Thank you for being interested in my workshop! This is a free workshop being presented as part of Linuxfest Northwest 2018. We have a lot to get through in the course of two hours, so I am asking everyone to arrive with a working development environment and ready to start working.

Jasper is a virtual assistant that runs well on a Raspberry Pi computer.

What I need you to bring is a virtual machine running Debian Stretch from the 1st DVD (<a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso">debian-9.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso</a>) which you can download from https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/ (or get the 32 bit version from https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-dvd/debian-9.4.0-i386-DVD-1.iso if that's how you roll). It also has to have access to speakers and a microphone to work.

I have prepared a video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15V76DZKXPs explaining exactly what to do.

Please check back, I will also be posting a tar file containing files needed for the workshop (which will also be available on usb zip drive at the tutorial).

Thanks,
Aaron
